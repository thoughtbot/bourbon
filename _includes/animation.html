  <p>The animation mixins support comma separated lists of values, which allows different transitions for individual properties to be described in a single style rule. Each value in the list corresponds to the value at that same position in the other properties.</p>

{% highlight scss %}
box:hover {
  @include animation-name(scale, slide);
  @include animation-duration(2s);
  @include animation-timing-function(ease);
  @include animation-iteration-count(infinite);

  // Animation shorthand works the same as the CSS3 animation shorthand
  @include animation(scale 1.0s ease-in, slide 2.0s ease);
