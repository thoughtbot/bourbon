# Bourbon Website and Documentation

This website is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Hereâ€™s how to get it working locally:

1. Make sure you have Jekyll and [Pygmentize](https://github.com/djanowski/pygmentize) (for code highlighting) installed:

  ```bash
  gem install jekyll
  ```
  ```bash
  gem install pygmentize
  ```

2. Run the server and watch for changes:

  ```bash
  jekyll serve -w
  ```

3. Watch and compile Sass:

  ```bash
  sass --watch stylesheets/home:stylesheets stylesheets/docs:stylesheets
  ```

  _Jekyll now has a [built-in](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets) Sass convertor, but it sucks._

***

To pull in the latest changes on gh-pages branch:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin gh-pages
```

To update the Bourbon files:

```bash
bourbon update
```

This will delete the Bourbon directory and regenerate it. Of course, make sure your Bourbon gem is up-to-date: `gem update bourbon`.

***

### Add a new mixin, function or add-on to the docs

1. Create a new file in the `_includes/mixins/` (or `_includes/functions/`/`_includes/addons/`) directory:

  ```bash
  touch _includes/mixins/box-shadow.html
  ```

2. Add the link to `navigation.html`

  ```bash
  edit _includes/navigation.html
  ```

3. Add the partial to `mixins.html`

  ```bash
  edit _includes/mixins.html
  ```

4. Add the mixin to the `complete-list.html`

  ```bash
  edit _includes/complete-list.html
  ```

***

For code highlighting in Jekyll:

```liquid
{% highlight scss %}
insert code here
{% endhighlight %}
```

***

To generate or update the docset (for [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash)), run:

```bash
rake docset
```

Since the update will go live to all users as soon as you push, make sure the generated docset displays correctly by un-archiving
`docset/bourbon.tgz` and opening it in Dash.
