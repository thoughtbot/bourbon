## A Lightweight Sass Tool Set

[Bourbon] is a library of [Sass] mixins and functions that are designed to make
you a more efficient style sheet author.

It is…

- Dependency-free: Bourbon is pure Sass.
- Human-readable: We aim for clarity over brevity.
- Lightweight: Zero output post-install and has no visual opinion.

The current version is **4.2.7**. The `master` branch on GitHub is version
5.0.0.beta.7.

## Requirements

- [Sass] 3.4+ or [LibSass] 3.3+

  [Sass]: https://github.com/sass/sass
  [LibSass]: https://github.com/sass/libsass

## Installation

1. Install the Bourbon gem using the [RubyGems] package manager:

  ```bash
  gem install bourbon
  ```

  Alternatively, you can install Bourbon with [Bower].

1. Install the Bourbon library into the current directory:

  ```bash
  bourbon install
  ```

  **Pro Tip:** You can target installation into a specific directory using the
  `path` flag:

  ```bash
  bourbon install --path my/custom/path/
  ```

1. Import Bourbon at the beginning of your stylesheet:

  ```scss
  @import "bourbon/bourbon";
  ```

  It’s not recommended that you modify Bourbon’s files directly as it will make
  updating to future versions difficult, by overwriting your custom changes or
  causing merge conflicts.

  [Bower]: http://bower.io

### Installation for Ruby on Rails 4.2+

1. Add Bourbon to your Gemfile:

  ```ruby
  gem "bourbon"
  ```

1. Then run:

  ```bash
  bundle install
  ```

1. Restart your server and rename `application.css` to `application.scss`:

  ```bash
  mv app/assets/stylesheets/application.css app/assets/stylesheets/application.scss
  ```

1. Delete _all_ Sprockets directives in `application.scss` (`require`,
   `require_tree` and `require_self`) and use Sass’s native `@import` instead
   ([why?][sass-import]).

1. Import Bourbon at the beginning of `application.scss`. Any project styles
   that utilize Bourbon’s features must be imported after Bourbon.

  ```scss
  @import "bourbon";
  @import "home";
  @import "users";
  ```

### Installing with npm and using a Node-based asset pipeline

1. Add Bourbon as a dependency:

  ```bash
  npm install --save bourbon
  ```

1. If you’re using [eyeglass], skip to Step 3. Otherwise,
you’ll need to add Bourbon to your node-sass `includePaths` option.
`require("bourbon").includePaths` is an array of directories that you should
pass to node-sass. How you do this depends on how node-sass is integrated into
your project.

1. Import Bourbon into your Sass files:

  ```scss
  @import "bourbon";
  ```

### Installing older versions of Bourbon

1. Uninstall any Bourbon gem versions you already have:

  ```bash
  gem uninstall bourbon
  ```

1. Reinstall the Bourbon gem, using the `-v` flag to specify the version
   you need:

  ```bash
  gem install bourbon -v 3.2.4
  ```

1. Follow the [instructions above](#installation) to install Bourbon into
   your project.
